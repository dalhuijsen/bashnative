UM, so multiple versions?  mergin strategy? whattodooo?
Use the lowest common denominator for everything?
Installer that creates the right versions of the progs for that environment?
Modular functions in libfiles that switch when env changes?
Programs that switch to the most optimal settings for their runtime env?

what do does i prefer???? Portability vs elegance vs speed vs prechecking vs ....
