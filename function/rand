# @Usage:  rand INTEGER will return a random number in the range (0, INTEGER]
# @Depends: none
# 
# The bash RANDOM variable returns a pseudorandom number in the range (0,32767)
# -- 32768 distinct values.  Therefore, to ensure we get a number in the range
# (0,INTEGER], we must ensure that integer division RANDOM / DIVISOR *never*
# equals 1; Hence, we must use 32768 as the DIVISOR.
# 
rand() {
    echo $(( $1 * RANDOM / 32768 ))
}
