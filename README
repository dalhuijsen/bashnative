# WARNING/PREREQUISITES (Anything less or different prolly won't work :p
# GNU bash, version >= 4.2.10  <== That means no to you osX yuppies out there
# LiNUX (any distro should do as long as it has a working /proc)
# EVEN MORE WARNING: all of this probably does NOT hold up to its realworld c counterparts.
# that said, let me know any and all bugs.. most of these are joke implementations, but who knows,
# one day,... :-)
