 Project completion: ~ 3%
 Latest milestone: Working CHROOT implementation. (*)
 Top priority: mk{nod,dir,fifo} *help?! howto do this without external binaries*
 

 Project goal status:
 
   BusyBox replacement: 5%;
   CoreUtils replacement: 1%;



 Bashnative currently provides:

   basename bash cat clear date dirname editor find gopherd login ls man 
   nano pico rootshell seq sh telnet true uptime vi vim whereis whoami 
   curl wget [1]


 
 Underlying philosophy:

   Have a 'truly open source' operating system; if all the programs are just
   ascii files with the executable bit set, it becomes very easy to modify
   on runtime.  Main reason however is just for fun. No way would I recommend
   the memory model and runtime speed of the Bourne Again SHell for large 
   production systems.

	To provide a minimal system to be used in, for instance, chrooted 
	environments it can be, and already has proven so, an alternative to
	bigger systems.

	No compilation necessary, not ever, a text editor is all you need.









 [1] disclaimer: even though the programs are similar in functionality as
     their named counterparts, they are not exact copies.  Furthermore some
     are just links, for instance, vim, vi, nano and pico all link to the
     editor program. These links are just there for usability reasons.
